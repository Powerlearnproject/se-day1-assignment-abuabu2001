#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline of engineering that focuses on the systematic development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. It applies principles of computer science, engineering, and project management to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software products.
Importance:

	•	It ensures that software is built to meet user requirements.
	•	It reduces development costs by improving efficiency and minimizing errors.
	•	It ensures software reliability, scalability, and maintainability, which are critical in today’s technology-dependent society.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

	1.	1950s - Invention of High-Level Programming Languages: The creation of programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL allowed developers to write code in a more readable format, revolutionizing software development.
	2.	1970s - Structured Programming: This introduced the concept of dividing programs into smaller, manageable modules or blocks, increasing code readability and maintainability.
	3.	1990s - Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP introduced concepts like classes and inheritance, which made software more modular, reusable, and easier to manage, a fundamental change in software engineering.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.	Planning: Define the project’s goals, scope, and feasibility.
	2.	Requirements Analysis: Gather and analyze the functional and non-functional requirements.
	3.	Design: Architect the software’s structure and user interfaces.
	4.	Implementation (Coding): Write the code based on design specifications.
	5.	Testing: Ensure the software works as intended and is free of bugs.
	6.	Deployment: Deliver the software to the end-users.
	7.	Maintenance: Ongoing support to fix issues and add features.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

	•	Waterfall:
	•	Sequential: Each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving to the next.
	•	Example: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., government or regulatory software).
	•	Agile:
	•	Iterative and Incremental: Software is developed in small increments and continuously tested.
	•	Example: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as mobile app development.

Comparison:

	•	Waterfall is rigid and linear, making it best for projects where changes are minimal.
	•	Agile is flexible and encourages collaboration, making it better for projects with dynamic requirements.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

	•	Software Developer: Designs, codes, and implements software features. They collaborate with other team members to build functional software.
	•	Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures the software meets the required standards through testing, identifying defects, and verifying fixes.
	•	Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, resource allocation, and ensures the team meets deadlines while maintaining quality.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


	•	IDEs: Provide a comprehensive environment for writing, debugging, and compiling code. Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA.
	•	VCS: Tracks changes to code over time, enabling collaboration and version history. Examples: Git, SVN.

Importance:

	•	IDEs enhance productivity by offering tools that streamline development.
	•	VCS enables multiple developers to collaborate efficiently and revert to previous versions if needed.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
•	Challenge: Handling Changing Requirements.
	•	Solution: Adopt Agile methodologies to allow flexibility and continuous feedback.
	•	Challenge: Debugging Complex Code.
	•	Solution: Use debugging tools in IDEs, unit tests, and peer code reviews.
	•	Challenge: Time Management and Meeting Deadlines.
	•	Solution: Prioritize tasks using project management tools like Jira, and implement time tracking for accountability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
•	Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions of a program in isolation.
	•	Integration Testing: Ensures that different modules work together as intended.
	•	System Testing: Verifies the entire system’s functionality to ensure it meets requirements.
	•	Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software is ready for delivery and satisfies the user’s needs.

Importance: Each type of testing ensures that different aspects of the software function properly and that the software is reliable, reducing the likelihood of issues after deployment.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to AI models like GPT to produce specific, desired outputs.
Importance:

	•	It allows for precise interactions with AI models, improving the relevance and accuracy of responses.
	•	Effective prompts help AI deliver results that align with user intentions, saving time and enhancing productivity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
•	It is specific, asking for information about public healthcare in developing countries rather than a broad topic.
	•	It is clear, outlining the specific challenges (funding, infrastructure, staffing).
	•	It is concise, giving the AI clear guidance on the scope and focus of the answer, which results in more relevant and detailed responses.
